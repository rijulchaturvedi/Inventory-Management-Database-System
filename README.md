Business Description:
This project aims to develop an efficient Inventory Management System and Stock Tracker tailored for businesses handling physical products. The system focuses on managing stock levels to meet customer demands, optimize capital and storage space, and improve overall profitability by minimizing costs associated with excess inventory or stockouts.

Problem Statement:

	1.	Manual inventory processes result in inaccuracies, stockouts, and overstocking, negatively affecting profitability.

Proposed Solution:
The project will address these issues by implementing the following key objectives:

	1.	Real-time Inventory Tracking: Monitor stock levels and locations across warehouses.
	2.	Streamlined Order Processing: Track orders from placement to fulfillment, updating inventory in real-time.
	3.	Alerts and Notifications: Automated alerts for low stock levels, overstocking, and expirations.
	4.	Reports and Analysis: Generate performance, inventory, and sales reports, along with trend analysis in sales and warehousing.
	5.	User Interface and Graphics/Charts: Incorporate access controls, authorization, and data security features.

Entities and Attributes:

	•	Product: ID, Name, Description, Category, Unit Price, Quantity
